**THIS WEBPAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

Hello! I am Peter Súkeník, a Ph.D. student at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), proud to be co-supervised by [Prof. Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/) and [Prof. Christoph Lampert](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/).
I am currently most interested in selected topics in theory of deep learning. For example I am intrigued by a structure in learned representations, such as low-rank matrices, neural collapse or extreme tokens and the related attention sinks. 
My focus is on understanding, how are the mentioned phenomena influenced by weight regularization or other key training parameters.

During my PhD I have worked extensively on the [neural collapse](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015509117) phenomenon, having produced three [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/) papers ([1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/a60c43ba078b723d3d517d28c50ded4c-Abstract-Conference.html),
[2](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/f9c2ab8d429044e0c35bcece2ff6d123-Abstract-Conference.html), [3](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/ec045a5ca2d8cfc528591b4c34296370-Abstract-Conference.html), one spotlighted), one 
[ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) paper ([4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04887) - oral presentation) and one [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15239).

Before joining ISTA, I studied masters in mathematics at Technical University Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/?r=1)), focusing strongly on ML and prob-stats topics with a bit of a financial flavor. Even before, I did my 
bachelor's degree in finantial and economical mathematics at Comenius University Bratislava ([UK](https://uniba.sk/en/)). 

Besides research, I like to do many things, but in particular sports and game design. My most favorite sports are competitive math and running, but I also enjoy gym, ultimate frisbee, cycling, dancing, climbing, hiking, floorball and many others. In competitive math, I successfully [represented](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26652) Slovakia on [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/),
but also myself on many other events. Now I serve as a organizer of Slovakian math olympiad and math camps and for many years I organized another math [competition](https://kms.sk/). My PB's in running are: 

- 5K: 18:43
- 10K: 38:34
- Half-marathon: 1:21:56
- Marathon: TBD!
