THIS WEBPAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION! (As you could have noticed, since I don't really look like AE)

Hello! I am Peter Súkeník, a Ph.D. student at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/), proudly co-supervised by [Prof. Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/) and [Prof. Christoph Lampert](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/).
I am currently most interested in selected topics in theory of deep learning. For example I am intrigued by a structure in learned representations, such as low-rank matrices, neural collapse or extreme tokens and the related attention sinks. 
My focus is on understanding, how are the mentioned phenomena influenced by weight regularization.
